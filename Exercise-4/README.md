# Visual Encoding of Data

**Name:** Swetha P

**Roll Number:** 23BAD119

---

## Project Overview

This experiment focuses on applying **visual encoding techniques** to represent complex traffic accident data using a single visualization. Multiple data attributes are encoded using visual properties such as color, size, and shape to effectively communicate accident severity, casualty impact, and accident type across different locations.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`4.traffic_accidents.csv`) contains traffic accident records with the following attributes:

* Location
* Number of vehicles involved
* Accident severity
* Number of casualties
* Accident type

The dataset is used to analyze and visually represent traffic accident risk factors.

---

## Software and Tools Used

* **R Programming Language**
* **RStudio**

**Libraries Used:**

* `ggplot2` – visual encoding and multivariate data visualization

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded the required R library (`ggplot2`).
2. Imported the traffic accident dataset using `read.csv()`.
3. Mapped accident locations to the x-axis and number of vehicles involved to the y-axis.
4. Encoded accident severity using **color variations**.
5. Represented the number of casualties using **point size encoding**.
6. Differentiated accident types using **distinct point shapes**.
7. Generated a multivariate scatter plot to visualize traffic accident risk patterns.

## Visualisation Techniques Implemented

* **Color Encoding:** Represents accident severity (Minor, Major, Fatal)
* **Size Encoding:** Indicates the number of casualties
* **Shape Encoding:** Differentiates accident types
* **Scatter Plot:** Displays multivariate relationships

*(The implemented chart is included separately.)*

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how visual encoding techniques can effectively represent multiple dimensions of data within a single chart. By mapping traffic accident attributes to visual properties such as color, size, and shape, the visualization provides clear insights into accident severity and risk patterns, supporting improved traffic safety analysis and decision-making.

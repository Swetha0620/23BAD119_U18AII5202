# Designing Multivariate Patterns

**Name:** Swetha P

**Roll Number:** 23BAD119

## Project Overview

This experiment focuses on designing and analyzing multivariate patterns using data visualization techniques in R. The objective is to study relationships among multiple health-related variables simultaneously to support early disease prediction in a healthcare analytics scenario.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient health records collected for analytical purposes, including the following variables:

* Age
* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Glucose level
* Blood pressure

The data is used to identify interrelationships among multiple health indicators and uncover potential risk patterns.

---

## Software and Tools Used

* **R Programming Language**
* **RStudio**

**Libraries Used:**

* `ggplot2` – multivariate data visualization
* `dplyr` – data manipulation
* `GGally` / correlation functions – scatter plot matrix and correlation analysis

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded the required R libraries for multivariate visualization and analysis.
2. Imported the patient health dataset into R.
3. Examined the dataset structure and summary statistics.
4. Generated a **scatter plot matrix** to visualize pairwise relationships among Age, BMI, Glucose, and Blood Pressure.
5. Applied **color encoding** to represent age groups or health categories.
6. Performed **correlation analysis** to identify relationships between health variables.
7. Interpreted multivariate patterns relevant to early disease prediction.

## Visualisation Techniques Implemented

* **Scatter Plot Matrix:** Pairwise relationship analysis among multiple variables
* **Color Encoding:** Visual grouping based on age or risk category
* **Correlation Analysis:** Identification of strongly related health indicators

*(The implemented charts are included separately.)*

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of multivariate visualization techniques in healthcare analytics. By analyzing multiple health variables together, meaningful patterns and correlations can be identified that assist in early disease prediction and support data-driven preventive healthcare decisions.

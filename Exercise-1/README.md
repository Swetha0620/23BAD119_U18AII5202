## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the **implementation of data visualization charts using R** to analyze student performance data. The project focuses on computing internal assessment averages and visualizing subject-wise performance, test-wise trends, and grade distribution using `ggplot2`.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`1.student_performance.csv`) contains student academic performance details, including:

* Roll Number
* Subject names
* Internal Test 1 marks
* Internal Test 2 marks
* Final grades

The data is used to compute average internal marks and generate meaningful visual insights.

---

## Software and Tools Used

* **R Programming Language**
* **R version 4.4.1**
* **RStudio** (IDE)
* **Libraries:**

  * `ggplot2` – for data visualization
  * `dplyr` – for data manipulation
  * `tidyr` – for data reshaping

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded the required R libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`).
2. Imported the student performance dataset using `read.csv()`.
3. Explored the dataset structure and summary statistics.
4. Calculated the average of Internal Test 1 and Internal Test 2 for each student.
5. Computed subject-wise mean internal marks.
6. Created a **bar chart** to visualize subject-wise average internal marks.
7. Generated a **line chart** to analyze performance trends across Internal Test 1 and Internal Test 2.
8. Calculated grade proportions and visualized them using a **pie chart**.

---

## Charts Implemented

* **Bar Chart:** Subject-wise Average Internal Marks
* **Line Chart:** Performance Trend Across Internal Tests
* **Pie Chart:** Final Grade Distribution

**(The implemented charts are included seperately)**

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how R can be effectively used for **exploratory data analysis and visualization**. The charts provide clear insights into subject-wise performance, test-wise trends, and grade distribution, making it easier to interpret academic data and support data-driven academic evaluation.
